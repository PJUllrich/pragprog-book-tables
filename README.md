This is the reference implementation of the demo project of the book `Build Table Views with Phoenix LiveView`.

You can find the starter version of the application to which we'll add the code step-by-step in [pragprog-book-tables-starter-app.zip](https://github.com/PJUllrich/pragprog-book-tables/blob/main/pragprog-book-tables-starter-app.zip). It was created by the super kind [@thebrianemory](https://github.com/thebrianemory) who went through the book backwards and removed all code that we added! Now, you can download that version and add the code from the book step-by-step yourself. Super great work, Brian! Thank you so much! ‚ù§Ô∏èüíõüíôüíöüß°

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
